# The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset

## Overview

This dataset allows for the prediction of whether breast cancer is benign or malignant based on features computed from digitized images of breast mass. The characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the images serve as the basis for these features.

## Attributes

The dataset comprises 30 features for each cell nucleus, with no missing attribute values. These features are derived from ten real-valued measurements, which include:

- Radius
- Texture
- Perimeter
- Area
- Smoothness
- Compactness
- Concavity
- Concave points
- Symmetry
- Fractal dimension

For each image, the mean, standard error, and 'worst' or largest value of these features were computed, resulting in 30 distinct features in total.

## Data Usage

The detailed information provided by these features can be utilized in various machine learning models to predict the nature of breast cancer. Researchers and data scientists can leverage this dataset to build and train models that can accurately classify tumors into benign or malignant categories.
